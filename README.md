Improved Ergonomic Apple Magic Mouse


# Purpose
Quick practice assignment during design class was to redesign an object in the room. Being critical of the ergonomics of the Apple Magic Mouse, I chose it. Materials provided were cardboard, pipe cleaners, clay, etc. Having some previous 3D modeling experience, I made use of the Makerbot in the back of the room instead. In addition to 3D printing, rendered photorealistic images of what the product would look like with proper materials.

Initial renders during class were sub-par, later my strengthened knowledge about lighting a scene in Indigo to vastly improve quality.
